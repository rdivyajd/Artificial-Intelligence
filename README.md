## N-Queens_Rooks.ipynb

* The N-ROOKS problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no rooks can take any other, i.e. such that no two rooks share the same row or column.

* The N-QUEENS problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N Queens on the board so that no rooks can take any other, i.e. such that no two queens share the same row or column or diagonal.

* Uses Breadth First and Depth First Search Algorithms

## 15-Puzzle-Solver.ipynb

* Solve a variant of 15 - Puzzle Problem

 * Problem Description:
   * Instead of sliding a single tile from one cell into an empty cell, in this variant, either one, two, or three tiles  
   * may be slid left, right, up or down in a single move
   * 
   * The goal is to find a short sequence of moves that restores the canonical configuration given an initial board 
   * configuration using A* search.
